# Journal results ledger

The numbers of record for the journal study. One section per experiment (PLAN.md v2: E0–E9), appended as
runs finish.

For every result, record:
- run ID(s) from `results/RUNS.csv`;
- backbone, method, data (subset / seed);
- code branch and commit;
- evaluation surface (holdout / dev / validation-public), with sample counts;
- per-dataset metrics plus the task macro, and the malformed, truncation and omission
  rates;
- deviations from PLAN.md §1, if any.

Raw predictions go to `predictions/<study>/<run_id>/`.

Challenge-era numbers never go here; they live in `../references/challenge_results/`.

## Setup findings (2026-10-14; moved here from STATUS on 2026-10-19)

**ws and the box are not bit-reproducible.** Same code, data, decks, packages and seed; the
50-step smoke adapters (`j26_q35_shared_full_768_s1337_smoke` on ws, `..._smoke_bw` on the box)
give different greedy outputs on 50 holdout questions per task. Identical raw outputs per task:
cls 39/50, ML 36/50, report 41/50, count 23/50, reg 15/50, det 0/50. Kernels differ (sm_120 vs
sm_86). Counting MAE 38.2 (ws) vs 76.2 (box), almost all from three degenerate answers of a barely
trained adapter. Consequence: every compared run is trained and evaluated on the box (PLAN.md §1.12).

**Throughput on GPU 1 (Qwen, 768², 50-step runs).** One run alone: 1.196 s/example (ws 1.665),
card ~53% busy. Three at once (`..._conc3_{1,2,3}`): 1.75–1.76 s/example each, ≈ 1.70 examples/s
in total = 2.0× one run; ~17 GB reserved each. Same config and seed, final losses 0.6376 / 0.6424
/ 0.6401 (alone 0.6417): run-to-run noise at the ~1% loss level even on one box.

**Full runs (3 at once, measured).** Shared s1337 ≈ 48.5 h; TaskLoRAs s1337: cls 26.9 h, report
10.0 h, ML 9.0 h, reg 6.0 h, det 4.5 h, count 1.2 h (57.6 h total); Shared r48 s1337 ≈ 52 h
(12.3 s/it averaged, partly with 4 jobs on the card).

## E0 / E1 — Qwen3.5-9B, seed 1337, holdout (first numbers; 2026-10-17)

**Provisional: one seed; report generation not yet scored (CRIMSON pending); no bootstrap CIs.**

- Runs: `j26_q35_zsbare_holdout_768`, `j26_q35_zsprompt_holdout_768` (E0);
  `j26_q35_shared_full_768_s1337`, `j26_q35_task{cls,det,count,reg,ml}_full_768_s1337` (E1).
- Training commit `5199a58` (Shared and TaskLoRAs); eval commit `a0ff450`, `code/eval/eval_arm.py`
  (one question at a time, greedy, EOS pinned, 512 tokens), box `mbz-yaqub` GPU 1.
- Surface: holdout, 4,447 questions (TaskLoRAs: their own task slice, oracle route).
- Scorer: `code/eval/score_single.py`. Metrics files on the box:
  `<run_dir>/metrics_holdout_noreport.json` (per dataset + task macro); predictions
  `<run_dir>/predictions_holdout.json`.

Shared r48 (`j26_q35_shared48_full_768_s1337`, r48 α96, training commit `a0ff450`) added 2026-10-19;
0 truncated / 0 malformed.

- Fine-tuned arms: 0 truncated, 0 malformed on every task.
- ZS-bare truncated at 512 tokens on cls 244, ML 42, reg 48, count 14, report 3; malformed
  detection 99 (ZS-prompt: 41). The zero-shot cls/det numbers are mostly a format failure (the
  answer is not in a parseable form), not only a capability gap. PLAN.md E0 asks for exactly this
  ZS-prompt − ZS-bare reading; do not read 0.004 as "the model knows nothing".
